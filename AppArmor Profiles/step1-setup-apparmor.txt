In addition:
Variables (eg @{HOME} can be defined and manipulated outside the profile
(#include <tunables/global> for @{PROC} and @{HOME})
explicit deny rules are supported to override allow rules (eg access to
@{HOME}/bin/bad.sh is denied with auditing due to audit deny
@{HOME}/bin/** mrwkl, even though general access to @{HOME} is permitted with
@{HOME}/** rw,) include files are supported to ease development and simplify
profiles (ie #include <abstractions/base>,
#include <abstractions/nameservice>,
#include <abstractions/user-tmp>)
profiles can be loaded at boot time (eg apparmor=1 security=apparmor
