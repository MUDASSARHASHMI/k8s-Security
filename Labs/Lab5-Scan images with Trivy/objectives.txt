1. Use Trivy to scan images used in Pods
2. Delete Pods that have container images with svere vulnerabilities

Objective1
Use Trivy to Scan Images used in Pods in a Namespace:

- First we have to look that what images are being used by the Pods in namespace.
- One easy but time consuming way it to use "describe" flag for each of the Pod to see its image.
- Second way is to just create a custom output from all Pods manifests for the image fields.
    $ kubectl get pods -n sunnydale --output=custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,IMAGE:.spec.containers[*].image"
- We will get a list of images used by pods in namespace.
- Now we will use "Trivy" to scan images and we will only scan for high or critical level
vulnerability.
    $ trivy image -s HIGH,CRITICAL busybox:1.33.1
    $ trivy image -s HIGH,CRITICAL nginx:1.14.2
- We will get the result if its vulnerable or not.

Objective2
Delete Pods that have container images with svere vulnerabilities:
- To delete a Pod with vulnerabilities:
    $ kubectl delete pod -n namespace_name pod_name
- We can also use "--force" flag but then the Pod will not be deleted gracefully instead it will
instantly forcefully removed by the system.
