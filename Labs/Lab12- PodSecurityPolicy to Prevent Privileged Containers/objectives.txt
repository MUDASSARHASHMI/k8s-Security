Objectives:
1. Create a PodSecurityPolicy to Prevent Privileged Containers
2. Use the PodSecurityPolicy to Secure a Namspace

Objective1:
Create a PodSecurityPolicy to Prevent Privileged Containers

- To accomplish this objective we need to create a PodSecurityPolicy attached to this lab as
"step1-nopriv-psp.yml".
- With that first objetive is completed.

Objective2:
Use the PodSecurityPolicy to Secure a Namspace

- As next step we need to create a service account to attach that security policy.
- We will create "step2-hoth-sa.yml" for ServiceAccount attached to this lab.
- Next we need to create a cluster role that will allow the usage of PodSecurityPolicy.
- "step3-use-nopriv-psp-cluster-role.yml" is the file to create cluster role and attached to the lab.
- Now we need to create a ClusterRoleBinding to bind the cluseter role to ServiceAccount.
- Finally we completed the implementation of PodSecurityPolicy and now we need to test it with
creating a Pod.
- This Pod if failed then security policy will be working correctly sicnce in the Pod specs we
set "privileged: true".
    $ kubectl create -f pod-to-test-psp.yml
- We get the forbidden message and Pod is not created.
