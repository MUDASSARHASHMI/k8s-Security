A CIS benchmark contains guidance from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) on best
practices for configuring IT systems, networks, and software. The CIS has released over
140 benchmarks with the support of cybersecurity professionals and subject matter experts
in communities worldwide.

Problem1. Issues reported by CIS benchmark with few vulnerabilities for Kubelet.
Such as kubelet is configured for authentication.
Solution1: To access kubelet go to config file and make changes at "/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml"
    - Annonymous Authentication
    - Turn Webhook to true under authorization
    - Set authorization mode to "Webhook" from "AlwaysAllow"
    - Restart the Kubelet server
    - Check the status of kubelet server to make sure everything is fine.
Problem2. Issue reported by CIS Benchmark for kube-apiserver. We need to turn off profiling as per
suggested security considerations. Also ensure authorization mode is not set to "AlwaysAllow".
Finally we need to make sure that authorization mode includes "Node" and "RBAC".

Solution: Access the kube-apiserver manifest at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml.
In the file under "spec.container.command" after first entry "kube-apiserver" add new flag.
Objective1.    - --profiling=false
Objective2.    - --authorization-mode=Node,RBAC

Problem3. We need to fix CIS Benchmark issues for etcd.
- We need to set client-auth-cert to true.

Solution3:
One of the major problem is that if we make changes to etcd manifest directly we run into issues as
old etcd instance still occupies the port while shutting down and new instance keeps getting
conflicts. Best suited solution is to get rid of etcd static pod and give it some time to shutdown
so what we do is that we move static pod manifest for etcd:
    $ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml /etc/kubernetes
We can make our changes to etcd there.
- We will go to /etcd/kubernetes/etcd.yaml # Second location where files was moved
- set "client-cert-auth=true".
- now we will move the file back to manifests folder
    $ sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/etcd.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
