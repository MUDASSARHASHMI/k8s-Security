Following are the Lab objectives.

1. Configure Admission Controller
2. Set the URL of the Image Scanning
3. Enable the Admission Controller Plugin

Objetive1:
Configure Admission Controller:

- Login to control plane server and check the path to admission-control.conf
    $ sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/admission-control/admission-control.conf
- Edit the imagepolicy.conf :
    $ sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/admission-control/imagepolicy.conf
- Our kubeconfig files location will be listed in config file at:
    /etc/kubernetes/admission-control/imagepolicy_backend.kubeconfig
- In "imagepolicy.conf" we need to set "defaultAllow" to "false" to make sure that images are
denied without scanning for vulnerabilities.
- Save and exit.

Objective2:
Set the URL of the Image Scanning:

- Go to "kubeconfig_backend.kubeconfig" file.
    $ sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/admission-control/imagepolicy_backend.kubeconfig
- Go to "clusters.server" and set the external image scanning url
    https://acg.trivy.k8s.webhook:8090/scan

Objective3:
Enable the Admission Controller Plugin:

- Edit kube-apiserver manifest:
    $ sudo vi /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
- Find the flag "--enable-admission-plugins" and add "ImagePolicyWebhook"
    - --enable-admission-plugins=NodeRestriction,ImagePolicyWebhook
- kube-apiserver will be unrsponsive for short amount of time.
- To test if ImagePolicyWebhook is scanning images before pulling create two pods one with
known vulnerabilities and one with no vulnerabilities as attached to this lab.
- With vulnerabilities it won't let the pod to be created.
- With no vulnerabilities it will be created successfully.
