Objectives:
1. Create a RunTime Class for Untrusted Workloads
2. Configure Pods to use gVisor

Objective1:
Create a RunTime Class for Untrusted Workloads

- Create a sandbox file.
    $ vi sandbox.yml
- Created file is attached with the lab. Just run it with kubectl to create RuntimeClass.
    $ kubectl create -f sandbox.yml
- hanlder "runsc" is already configured on the clusetr and not in scope of this lab. Also gVisor
installation can be followed from official docs.
- Objecive1 completed.

Objective2:
Configure Pods to use gVisor

- We can get the Pods listed out in the "sunnydale" namespace which we need to move to sandbox.
    $ kubectl get pods -n sunnydale
- The Pods listed out seems to have some random charachters as their IDs. Which means these Pods
are related to deployments in the namespace.
- To check deployments we will run
    $ kubectl get deployments -n sunnydale
- If this is the case then its pretty easy to move a deployment to a sandbox using gVisor.
    $ kubectl edit deployment -n sunnydale buffy
- Under the main "spec.template.spec" before containers we will add this runtime class created
earlier.
    runtimeClassName: sandbox
- If we run "kubectl get pods -n sunnydale". We will see the buffy is terminating for recreation.
- Now we need to see if all the Pods are running in Sandbox.
- We will simply use command to ensure that below:
    $ kubectl exec -n sunnydale buffy-7dhg8fsdf-fhgl -- dmesg
- It will print out on the first line of response something like:
    [   0.00000]Starting gVisor....
- So with that we have completed the objective.
