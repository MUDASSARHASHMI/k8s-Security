Objectives:
1. Analyze a Dockerfile for Security Best Practices
2. Analyze a YAML file for Security Best Practices
3. Ensure Containers are static and Immutable


Objective1:
Analyze a Dockerfile for Security Best Practices

- Dockerfile attached to this lab require analysis for best practices.
- The first issue in the Dockerfile is the use of ":latest" tag. We rather need to use fix
number based release so we can see if there are some future updates for that release.
- Second issue for the Dockerfile is use of "root" privileges in the end of Dockerfile.
- We should never let Dockerfile have root access to system because that creates a lot of
security concerns.
- For now we will use "nobody" user at the end.
- The first objective is completed.

Objective2:
Analyze a YAML file for Security Best Practices

- The file "scooby-gang-deploy.yml" requires analysis for best practices.
- One of the major mistake in "securityContext.privileged: true" is that we should never let
it set to "privilege: true". We will set it to false.
- Seoncd one is that we need to make sure no user has root access to containers as it shows
in "securityContext.runAsUser: 0". We will set it to "nobody" user with ID 65534.

Objective3:
Ensure Containers are static and Immutable

- Let us look Containers and Pods in "sunnydale" namespace.
    $ kubectl get pods -n sunnydale
- After listing out we can select each pod to see their details.
    $ kubectl get pod -n synnydale -o yaml buffy
- What we are looking for is to make sure none of the containers have special or elevated
privileges and also we need to check that container should not be able to write its own file
system.
- So in securityContext "allowPrivilegeEscalation" should be false unless some special case.
- In securityContext "runAsUser" shouldn't be set to "0" or root user.
- In securityContext another important tag is "readOnlyRootFilesystm" which should be true.
- If above criteria is met the container is considered as "mutable". Otherwise we cannot call
a container mutable.
- We will delete all the containers that do not meet the criteria for mutability.
    $ kubectl delete pod -n namespace_name pod_name --force
