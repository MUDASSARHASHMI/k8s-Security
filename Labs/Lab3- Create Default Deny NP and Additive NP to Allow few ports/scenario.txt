Problem1: Create a default deny network
Solution1. A default deny policy in simplest manifest is attached to the lab.

Problem2: Create a network policy to allow specific traffic
Solution2: Before we run into creating an additive network policy we need to see labels available
for "mordom" namespace that we can use while creating Network Policy.
    $ kubectl get pod mtdoom -n mordom --show-labels
Pod shows label "app=mtdoom" and we can use this lable to target our network policy to this Pod.
Now we do need to allow traffic from namespace "mordom" to "frodo" so let us see available labels
for "frodo" as well.
    $ kubectl get namespace frodo --show-labels
Now "frodo" namespace have "app=frodo" label available.
A file is attached with this lab as mtdoom-np.yml for Network Policy between "mordom" and "frodo".
