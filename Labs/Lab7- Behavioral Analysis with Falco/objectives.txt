Objectives:
1. Create a Falco Rules file
2. Log Activity from a suspicious container


Objective1:
Create a Falco Rules File:

- Intalling Falco for Kubernetes is out of the scope of this Lab as its just copy paste from docs.
- We simply need to create a Faclo rule file "monitor-rules.yml" attached to this lab.
- After the rules created the first objective is completed.

Objective2:
Log Activity from a Suspicious Container

- To see it in action we will implement Falco with following command
    $ sudo falco -M 45 -r monitor-rules.yml > falco_output.log
- After 45 seconds we can see the output file that is "falco_output.log" for all the spawned
processes.
- We can pull the log file to see what processes spawned during the time defined.
