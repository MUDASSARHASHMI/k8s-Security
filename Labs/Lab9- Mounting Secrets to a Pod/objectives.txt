Objectives:
1. Get a username and Password from an existing file
2. Create a Secret and Mount it to a Pod


Objective1:
Get a username and Password from an existing file

- Get the secret in Yaml output so we can see details
    $ kubectl get secret -n namespace_name secret_name -o yaml
- We can get the secrets and then we need to decode them from base64 as secrets are only accepted
in base64 format.
    $ echo YWRtaW4K | base64 --decode > username.txt
    $ echo MTIzNDUK | base64 --decode > password.txt
Objective2:
Create a Secret and Mount it to a Pod

- To create a secret we need to encode it with base64.
    - echo dbuser | base64
    - echo A83MaeKoz | base64
- Now lets create a secret and for that we will create a yml file moe.yaml
    $ kubectl create -f moe.yml
- Lets create a Pod yaml to apply the secret attached as secret-pod.yml
    $ kubectl create -f secret-pod.yml
- Now lets see if the Secret is implemented on the secret-pod
    $ kubectl logs -n larry secret-pod
- It will pop up the user/pass we setup as secret. We actually cat the user/pass in pod spec
command to see if its implemented.
