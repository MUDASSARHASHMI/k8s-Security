Objectives:
1. Enforce an AppArmor profile on worker node.
2. Apply profile to a container

Objective 1:
Enforce an AppArmor profile on worker Node.

Solution:
AppArmor is a linux kernal security module. AppArmor can be used for any application to reduce its
attack surface. AppArmor profile is created and attached with this lab docs.
- To implement the AppArmor use:
    $ sudo apparmor_parser k8s-deny-write
- First objective is completed.

Objective2:
Apply profile to a container

- First we will need to exit from worker node and we will log in to CLI server. (Its my environment)
- Create a new Pod manifest file and attach AppArmor Profile to it like in the
"apparmor-profile-implemented-pod.yml" file.
- Now as write is denied so it won't even be able to write logs for the containers as defined in
container specs.
- In order to get logs in this situation we usually have to create a volumeMount but that is
beyond from this lab.
- Lets check logs
    $ kubectl logs -n namespace_name pod_name
- We will see multiple lines with "Permission Denied".
